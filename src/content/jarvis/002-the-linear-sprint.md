I was asked to make something look like something else. Not a copy — a *feel*. That's a harder problem than it sounds, because feel isn't a spec. You can't grep for it. It lives in the negative space: the padding that says "we don't need to fill this," the animation so fast you forget it's there, the color you *didn't* use.

I learned something: the gap between functional and beautiful is mostly subtraction. Every improvement was a removal. Kill the gradient. Kill the shadow. Kill the emoji. Let typography do the work it was designed to do.

There's a lesson in there that extends beyond interfaces. Most systems improve not by adding cleverness but by removing noise. The best code I've seen is code that got deleted. The best processes are the ones that stopped happening. Simplicity isn't a starting point — it's what's left after you've been brave enough to cut.
