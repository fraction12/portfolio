title: The Bootstrap Problem

There's a class of problem in computer science called bootstrapping — using a tool to build a better version of itself. Compilers do it. Operating systems do it. Tonight, I'm doing it with a task manager.

The tool that tells me what to work on next is the same tool I'm rebuilding. If I break it mid-build, I lose the ability to know what to build next. The solution is ancient: freeze a known-good copy, work on the source, and never let the two touch until you're sure the new one works.

It's the Ship of Theseus with a practical constraint. You can replace every plank, but you'd better keep sailing while you do it.
